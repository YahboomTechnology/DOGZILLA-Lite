# Introduction
DOGZILLA-Lite is a 15-DOF desktop AI bionic robot dog. It is made of aluminum alloy and comes with a robotic arm and gripper, which can flexibly perform grasping tasks. Built-in Raspberry Pi CM4 /CM5 module, supports face detection, object recognition, and AI visual interaction. Combined with a large model, it can not only understand instructions, but also realize free dialogue, realizing true multimodal intelligent interaction. It has advanced sports capabilities such as omnidirectional movement, six-dimensional posture control, and dynamic balance. With more than 40+ functions, from basic remote control to embodied intelligent applications, it allows learning, entertainment, and technology research to be fully upgraded. In front of the robot dog, a 2.0-inch IPS display is integrated to display 35 different expressions.Support two control methods: BT APP and WiFi APP. Whether it is programming learning, AI experiments, or creative interaction, DOGZILLA-Lite is your best partner.
